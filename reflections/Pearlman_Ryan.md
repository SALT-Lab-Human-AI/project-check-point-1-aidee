### 4-6 Sentence summary:
This research paper followed an experiment regarding AI-tutors in multiple real math classrooms in Turkey. The researchers set up three classroom groups of students in school, each with a different situation: The first group was the control, and thus were taught and tested with no AI technology. The second group was given a ChatGPT-4 base wrapper, which made some mistakes and would give answers to students. The third group received a specialized ChatGPT-4 with a specific prompt telling it to never give the students the answer outright, and it had the correct answer and common mistakes written into its prompt for each question by the teacher. The control group did the best on a subsequent closed-book no-technology test, followed closely by the specialized ChatGPT-4 tutor being slightly worse, and lastly the ChatGPT-4 base model students fared much worse off in the final exam. However, the ChatGPT-4 students performed better on practice problems than the control, and the ChatGPT-4 tutor students outperformed both other categories by a very large margin. 

### 3 Insights I learned:
- Prompting an AI and giving it the answers and common mistakes can make a very big difference in students’ performance
- Students didn’t perform better on closed-book tests when their AIs were taken away than those who never had the AI to begin with
- If able, students will use AI tutors to cheat on problems and ask for the answers directly rather than engaging in meaningful conversation

### 2 Limitations/risks:
- Students can use AI tutors to cheat or as a crutch instead of properly learning the materials
- AI tutors make mistakes often, and students seem to be taking answers directly from the AI even if they are incorrect answers rather than carefully reading through and making sure the AI doesn’t make any mistakes in its work

### 1 Concrete idea this inspires for my project:
- We will implement our AI in such a way that it acts as a true tutor to the students, encouraging them to solve problems on their own, rather than something they can simply get an answer out of.

### 4-6 Sentence summary:
This research paper is less of a specific experiment and more of a literature review around AI tutors followed by a series of ideas regarding how best to train an AI tutor, and how best to use AI to help human tutors improve their tutoring skills. The researchers spoke directly with multiple AI chatbots as if they were a struggling student, then provided the bots feedback on how they could’ve better tutored the user. They also spoke to the chatbots as if they were the tutor for the bot, and then the chatbot told them how they could be a better tutor to the student afterwards based on their conversation. The researchers found that AIs can be used to help tutors improve their skills, and that there are many different prompts and chatbots for tutors to choose from in their learning.

### 3 Insights I learned:
- AI Tutors can be trained to learn what makes a good tutor in order to give better responses
- Human tutors aren’t always perfect themselves, and AI can help improve their skills
- There are many different ways to use and role-play with chatbots, especially in an educational and teaching context

### 2 Limitations/risks:
- AIs aren’t always accurate, so it may give incorrect feedback that doesn’t actually improve tutoring skills
- Humans aren’t always the best tutors, so an AI may receive training data that prompts it to tutor in a non-optimal fashion

### 1 Concrete idea this inspires for my project:
- We can model our AI tutor off of real tutors, and teach it in a way that is proper and leads to better outcomes for students
